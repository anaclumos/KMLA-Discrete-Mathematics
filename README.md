# `set.py` and `partition.py`

Python code for finding Set Number `S(n,k)` and Partition Number `p(n,k)`.  
Created in KMLA Discrete Mathematics Class as a *personal extra project*.

### Notable strengths
* Employs recursion.
* Remembers previous results to reduce repeated calculations. `Memoization`
* Therefore it's super fast!

### Note
Expand the length of predefined `data` list if `n` is bigger than 99.
